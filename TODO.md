1. Figure out what to do as npm and gulp are not in strech repos. Perhaps
   they'll find their way into stretch-backports later on.
2. Find a better solution for check_installed. The current one makes typos hard
   to catch.
3. Install Syncthing GTK application (Debian).
4. Set default share in Syncthing to Sync/ folder.
5. Port battery gauge from Arch zshrc.
6. Add function to disable audio beep, especially when hitting backspace in the
   terminal.
