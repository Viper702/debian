1. Add function to enable contrib and non-free repos.
2. Add function to install firmware (firmware-linux, firmware-iwlwifi, etc.)
3. Figure out what to do as npm and gulp are not in strech repos. Perhaps
   they'll find their way into stretch-backports later on.
4. Find a better solution for check_installed. The current one makes typos hard
   to catch.
