1. Figure out what to do as npm and gulp are not in strech repos. Perhaps
   they'll find their way into stretch-backports later on.
2. Find a better solution for check_installed. The current one makes typos hard
   to catch.
3. Install Syncthing GTK application.
4. Port battery gauge from Arch zshrc.
5. Stop piping to >/dev/null, it's hiding bugs from view.
