# Debian Post-Installation

This is a set of scripts for running post-installation tasks for Debian 9
(Stretch), 10 (Buster), or Unstable (sid). Works best if the Cinnamon or GNOME
desktop envorinments are already installed.

**Note:** Some Ubuntu packages have different names, so this script may not
work for some packages.
